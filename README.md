# Gatsby + Prismic

Build best-in-class static websites using [Gatsby][gatsby] and [Prismic][prismic].

**[Gatsby][gatsby] is a React-based open source framework** with performance, scalability and security built-in.

**[Prismic][prismic] is a content management system** that lets you choose your technology, framework, and language and then easily manage your content.

## Getting Started

If you are new to Gatsby, you can start by going through [Gatsby's in-depth tutorial on creating a site](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/).

Or if you want to dive straight into some code and see an example site using Prismic, you can check out [Prismic's example blog repository](https://github.com/prismicio/gatsby-blog).
